				<p>The first day’s concert report started with the performance by lead vocalist Sri Amit Chowdhury, who created the musical environment very effectively. This was followed by a kathak dance performance by father-daughter duo, Deepak and Ragini Maharaj. It was a visual treat that displayed the heritage of the Lucknow Gharana. The expert footwork and poise, well supported by Kumar Bose’s bright tabla elevated the entire performance. Then the audience was treated with another duet performance, Sanjeev Abhyankar’s generous vocal and the skillful flute of Shashank Subramanyam. In the later part of the day, The senior vocal artist and Sangeet Samman awardee, Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, mesmerized listeners with his Bageshree and Bhairavi accompanied by Abhijit Banerjee in tabla.</p>
				
				<p>The concert report of the second day began with a beautiful sarod recital by Abhisek Lahiri which brought the attention of the audience. Then there was a group dance performance of Kathakali dance by the Uma Memorial Kalalayam which was also appreciated. The santoor recital by Satish Vyas was charming in Madhuvanti and Kirwani. One of the best performances was by Bharati Pratap, an Agra Gharana follower. In her generous voice, she beautifully rendered alaap in the traditional style as well as a Meera bhajan. Another wonderful musical experience was the combination of Shubhendra Rao on sitar and Saskia Rao-de Haas on cello.</p>
				<blockquote>On the third day of the concert report, Omkar Dadarkar presented a flavor of the ragas, Marwa and Tilak Kamod through his beautiful voice. However, the well-trained voice of Armaan Khan, the son of Rashid Khan, was a discovery and brought appreciation from the audience considering his heritage. Mita Nag successfully proliferates the mind of the audience with her melodiously rendered sitar recital of Lalita Gauri, Purvi, and in Puriya Kalyan ragas. The concert became glorified with Amaan Ali Khan’s sarod. Amaan’s expertise with unique rhythmic movement created a beautiful blend of melody and compactness.</blockquote>
				<p>The fourth and concluding day’s concert report describes some memorable performances by both seniors as well as young talents. Atri Kotal’s vocal rendition and Indrajit Basu’s flute were the sparks of new talent. Another mystical performance was Debapriya Chatterjee Ranadive’s flute. The violin recital by Nandini Shankar was also very sweet to the ears. Jayteerth Mevundi’s voice and Anupama Bhagvat’s sitar recital also evoked a magical mood. Mevundi’s originality performed a new charm with varied voice modulations. On the other hand, Anupama’s fingers on sitar created some wonderful melodies and made a perfect balance between musicality and the technical aspects. The audience enjoyed the composition of ‘Talbadya’, a musical concert performed by Tanmoy Bose on tabla, Patri Satish Kumar on mridangam, Giridhar Udupa on ghatam.</p>
				
				<p>As per Dover lane Music Concert Report, some performances were enchanting while some did not meet the expectations of a certain section of the audience. But the music itself has a balanced and harmonious flow so the audience enjoyed the journey throughout. The music has something to be enjoyed beyond performance and criticism. Considering the nature of classical music from the traditional perspective, things are only supposed to be performed in certain ways. However, conventional classical music has welcomed some modernizations for commercial purposes. The overall arrangements focus on blending traditional music with contemporary music to create interest and attention among younger generations towards this glorious tradition of Indian classical music.</p>
				
				<p>The Dover Lane Music Concert Report communicates the message that, while maintaining its tradition for projecting highly sophisticated cultural values, also aimed at showing the world as well as Indian intellectuals that Hindustani music is the origin of many creative ideas and needed to be given a prestigious position.</p>
